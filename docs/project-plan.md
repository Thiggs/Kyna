# Kyna Project Plan

Kyna is a pet project and not directly revenue generating, so I plan to keep my day job; and of course, my day job will take priority over this project.

That said, my plan is to work most early mornings on the project and some evenings and Saturdays. Time has to be split between doing the work of the project and editing/publishing the videos of the work.

# Kyna Schedule

For estimating purposes, I think we should plan on 10 - 20 hours per week, with an average of 15 man-hours invested in real work each week (60 hour months). Given a possible roadmap below, getting to a working trend appears to be about 10 weeks of work. We'll try to pull that to the left as we go. I have a week between Christmas and New Years this year in which I might be able to put a big dent in whatever is still outstanding then.
